To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Source Code

All of the real meat and potatoes of the application is in src/app, where you can find the component, template, tests, and styles. The rest of it is generated by Angular's project generation command. Material Angular is used and imported through app.module.ts.
